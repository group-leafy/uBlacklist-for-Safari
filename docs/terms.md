These terms govern your use of Group-Leafy product.

### Privacy and Copyright Protection

[Privacy Policy](privacy) explains how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use our Services.

### About Software in Our Services

When a Service requires or includes downloadable software, this software may update automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available. Some Services may let you adjust your automatic update settings.

We gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by Group-Leafy, in the manner permitted by these terms. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our Services or included software, nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit those restrictions or you have our written permission.

### Modifying and Terminating Our Services

We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the terms regularly. We'll post notice of modifications to these terms on this page. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted. However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of the Service.

If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the additional terms will control for that conflict.
